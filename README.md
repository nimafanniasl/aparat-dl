# Simple command line tool to download videos from Aparat, written in ðŸ¦€ as a fun side-project to learn more about this amazing language :)

### Usage:
For now this project doesn't have any installers, but i provide pre-build linux binaries for you to download and run.

Use wget to get the binary:
```wget```

Then run it:
```./aparat-dl --help```

Example:

```./aparat-dl -l https://www.aparat.com/v/D9Emy -q 1080p```

Also, you can move it to your PATH and run it from anywhere. but i'm working on a installer to do that automatically :)

### TODO:
- [x] Downloads files correctly
- [ ] Provide pre-built binery's for windows and macos
- [ ] Get file save path as a optional arg from the user
- [ ] Show a progress bar of downloading the file
- [ ] Download playlists
- [ ] Make a installer for the project.
